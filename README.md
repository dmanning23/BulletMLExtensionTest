BulletMLLibSamples
==================

A quick sample program used to test teh BulletMLLib

This is about the minimum amount of work required to get BulletMLLib up and running.

Fire it up and use the A/Z keys or the A/X button on controller to switch patterns.

This "game" uses a few externals, so you will need to do "git submodule init" and "git submodule update" before it will work.

All the patterns are up on github:

All examples are built in Xamarin Studio 4.0.3
